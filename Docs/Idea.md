The idea is, there are three main tiers groups, and then three sub tiers of each group. 
I want the player to be able to unblock the sub tiers over time based off of the in-game day and your current rank. 
The idea for the dropping, there is one random drop a day that can go one tier above you. (I would say like 60-70% of cherry green once a day at the first tier then working way up 100% somewhere in the second group, then the mod will have a guaranteed (100%) two dead drops at the max tier.)
If the player wanted to order the player must message the guy (I noticed a typo and copied pasted Mrs Stacks, it's supposed to be Mr Stacks btw ðŸ˜…) to order another drop I would like it be limited to one drop a day at the base tier and then max tier up to three extra orders. 
Regarding individual tiers: I'm trying to make the mod slightly better than the loot you would get at that current time in the playthrough, so tier 1 would maybe one package meth or something like that with some other stuff 
Each drop should have at least one stack of cash(random + tier = amount), one or two good/useful items, then fill the rest of the drop with random stuff, clothing and mixing ingredients come to mind.

A drop should never be instant (only debug drop are aka "Paxdrops") 
For random drops the guy should msg the player something like," I'm going to be driving through your part of town in a couple hours (or tomorrow or w/e it is) with a new drop. Keep a lookout!"
When the drop occurs the player receives a message: "I finished the drop but I was a little too hot so I threw it in a random location. You'll have to go find it." (Or something like that, the idea is since he could go a tier beyond you won't have a waypoint and you would have to find it on your own) 

As for the drops the player orders, 
The first three responses are the three main tiers, then the player selects a tier. There are four responses, one for each sub-tier and then a go back button (when the player is in a sub menu there should always be a home option) the drops should be kind of costly for what they provide but not ridiculous, trying to make early game a little bit better, you should be almost getting your money back or slightly profit from it early on but late game the player should be making profit from it. 
Mr. Stacks should say something like: "All right, sounds good, I'll drop a <tier_name> package in <hours_till_drop> hours"
When the drop occurs: "Hey, check behind the casino. Your drop is ready" (or something like that)

I've also include a rough idea for the drop table in a md file and also included a txt file of all the valid items (far as I'm aware, got it in the discord)
