# 📦 PaxDrops Mod Overview

## 🧾 What It Does (Current)
PaxDrops adds an immersive dead drop system to *Schedule I*, delivering cash and loot based on in-game time, progress, and player rank.

- 📦 Scheduled drops appear at physical locations.
- 💵 Each drop contains random cash (up to $1,000) and mafia-sourced loot.
- 📈 Loot tiers scale with player day and rank.
- 📅 Drops are persistent using SQLite — not memory-based.
- 📱 NPC-based request system via phone contact: "Mr. Stacks".
- 🛠 Console commands available for dev/debug purposes.

## 🎯 Intended Design Goals
- Narrative-driven underground economy simulation.
- Day/rank-scaled rewards using mafia faction tiers.
- Modular, extensible, and persistent logic.
- Full integration with S1API's NPC, messaging, and time systems.

## 🚀 Future Plans
- More faction-based NPCs and voice lines.
- Alternate drop types (e.g. time-sensitive packages, deliveries).
- Full UI drop-tracker in-game.
- Player customization of drop preferences.
- Multiplayer-safe drop logic.

  - Ensures mod persists between scenes.
  - Hooks into scene loading.
- **Notes**: Should only control boot logic and not specific systems.

### `Logger.cs`
- **Purpose**: Custom logger for PaxDrops.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Provides color-coded, tag-based logging using MelonLoader/S1API.
  - Used via `Logger.Msg()`, `Logger.Warn()`, etc.

### `CommandHandler.cs`

### `DeadDrop.cs`
- **Purpose**: Manages in-world spawning of loot stacks.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Picks spawn location.
  - Places stack objects with generated contents.
  - Runs daily 7:00 AM check for scheduled drops.
  - Marks drops as completed in database.

### `DataBase.cs`
- **Purpose**: Manages persistence of drop data.

# 🧭 Code Flow Summary

### ▶️ On Load
1. `InitMain.cs` starts up and initializes all systems.
2. `DataBase.cs` loads any scheduled drops from SQLite.
3. `MrStacks.cs` hooks into the time system to send 7:30 AM messages.

### ⏰ At 7:00 AM
- `DeadDrop.cs` checks if a drop is scheduled for today.
- If yes, spawns the drop and marks it as complete in DB.

### 📱 At 7:30 AM
- `MrStacks.cs` sends SMS message from Mr. Stacks to player.

### 💬 When Player Opens Message
1. `MrStacksMsg.cs` walks through org → tier → confirm steps.
2. `TierLevel.cs` generates a new `DropPacket`.
3. `DataBase.cs` schedules the drop in SQLite.

### ⏰ Next 7:00 AM
- `DeadDrop.cs` spawns the requested drop using `DropPacket`.
